The title of the generated song is 'Running Water'. This song is generated by synchronous composition of multiple different threads
within the file. Each thread is responsible for a unique part of the song, and is also responsible for setting certain Time-State
objects to let other threads know where we are in relation to the timing of the song. The intent behind this song was to create
a form of Lofi song, as that is one of my favorite genres to listen to when I'm studying. The song, 'Running Water', takes inspiration
from the song 'Eternal Youth' by RUDE where its main melody has the timbre of an instrument akin to a mandolin. In the first couple
minutes of the song, there's a calm flow to the song as the beat is simple and the movement of the melody is simple as well, representative
of a lake's flow. Partway through the song, the beat becomes more intricate, and the melody becomes an improvisational riff, akin to quickly
flowing and changing water such as that of a creek. 'Running Water' also utilizes nostalgic sounds such as vinyl record noise and phone noise
to create an atmosphere of comfort and calm.
